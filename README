jQuery Plugin Collapsable

This is a very very small and simple jQuery plugin that makes a 
section able to collapse, usefull for menus. It works very similar
to the standard accordeon (I know it exists). The only difference
is that when expanding a section, if there was other sections
expanded, these won't collapse.

To use it, you just need to include the script in your app, and
place a basic HTML structure:

<div class="collapsable">
  <a class="collapse-control" href="#none"> Some Title </a>
    <ul class="list_content">
      <li>Some link</li>
      <li>Some other link</li>
      .
      .
      .
    </ul>
  </a>
</div>

Then in some JavaScript file included, just apply the plugin
to the elements:

$(document).ready(function(){
  $('.collapsable').collapsable();
});

And done!

Note that I made this just to use for a list of links I had in
another app, I didn't try with other kind of elements on list_content,
but you're free to grab it and use it for whatever you want.

Sorry for the lack of demo, I might add that someday.
